This project aims to further your knowledge in the world of elf-like binary exploitation
in i386 system.
The more or less complex methods you will use will give you a new perspective on IT
in general but mostly raise your awareness on issues coming from common programming
malpractice.
You will be challenged during this project. You have to overcome these challenges
by yourself. The way youâ€™ll be dealing with these challenges must be yours and YOURS
ONLY. The point is to help you develop some logic and acquire reflexes that will help
you all along your career.
